      "298 - 304  since the day I launched it. And so I'm really excited that you're here. I wanted to start with\n",
      "304 - 310  your role at Adobe. So for the longest time, you were a cheap product officer at Adobe. And then\n",
      "310 - 316  recently I noticed you shifted to this very complicated sounding role. I'm curious what this\n",
      "316 - 321  new role is and then why you made that shift. Well, in this new role, I'm overseeing strategy and\n",
      "321 - 326  corporate development, all of design across the company and emerging products for the business.\n",
      "327 - 333  If you look back at the last five years or so, it really has been about getting our core products\n",

      "338 - 345  opportunistic acquisitions over the years, ensuring that we have connectivity between the products,\n",

      "358 - 364  We have like the three-year immersive space, the stock business and how that whole space is being\n",
      "364 - 370  changed by new technology. The idea of bringing that into an organization and being able to\n",
      "370 - 375  focus on that full-time was really exciting to me. So what is it that you're doing data day now? Just\n",

      "380 - 386  the strategy of a company always needs to be iterated. And so being tasked with developing the strategy\n",
      "386 - 393  across the entire company, there's no shortage of opportunities and people to meet and things to\n",
      "393 - 399  think about there. Corporate development certainly like new M&A stuff and integration, all that sort of\n",
      "399 - 404  stuff falls under me as well. And I have a lot of feelings about that having been an entrepreneur that\n",
      "404 - 410  went through integration myself. So it's kind of fun to be on the other side and try to improve it.\n",
      "410 - 414  From that vantage point. On the design side, it's been a ton of time reviewing the design\n",
      "414 - 419  across every product and really trying to raise the bar for the experiences we're shipping.\n",
      "420 - 424  And that's a hard thing to do in a company that has a lot of legacy products, you know,\n",
      "424 - 428  and a lot of baggage that comes with them. And then on the emerging product side, it's really\n",
      "428 - 432  about the new products we're bringing into the market and how to make them win.\n",
      "432 - 437  Something that comes up on this podcast in a number of times is how CPO's rarely last at a company.\n",
      "437 - 441  They stay the case. You mentioned this and a few other people. They stay around for a couple of years.\n",
      "442 - 446  They're like the best they can do is just take a few swings at how things work and prove a few\n",
      "446 - 451  things. And then they see those like now. This is in great. And then find someone else. What do you\n",
      "451 - 456  think has contributed to you surviving and lasting and thriving and, you know, taking out more\n",
      "456 - 462  more responsibility at Adobe? Well, in the in the chief product of several, I oversaw design\n",
      "462 - 467  products and engineering. And I think part of the reason I was even interested in coming into\n",
      "467 - 474  the company and taking this role is that I felt like these boundaries between these functions are,\n",
      "474 - 483  at at best artificial at worse, like really constraining. And I always have felt like a lot of\n",
      "483 - 488  products win, not because of the technology, but the users experience of the technology. And so if\n",
      "488 - 493  you have an aligned team that gets that and makes decisions accordingly, I think you can ship\n",
      "493 - 499  better experiences. So a lot of the work I had to do was breaking some of these boundaries down\n",
      "499 - 503  over the years. And I think that a lot of chief product off cereals traditionally don't\n",
      "503 - 509  oversee engineering. And sometimes don't even oversee design. And for me, that wouldn't be interesting.\n",
      "509 - 515  Zooming into product. If there's a Mount Rush more of insightful product thinkers, I feel like\n",
      "516 - 520  part of the reason is that you have this incredible product sense. Whatever that means,\n",
      "521 - 525  it's clear that you have strong product sense. And PMs often talk about the importance of product\n",
      "525 - 530  sense and how to build product sense. And I'm curious how do you feel like you build your\n",
      "530 - 536  product sense? And what advice would you give to younger PMs looking to build product sense?\n",
      "536 - 542  First of all, one of the biggest mistakes that teams make is they become very passionate about\n",
      "542 - 548  solution to a problem they're trying to solve as opposed to do everything they can to develop empathy\n",
      "548 - 553  for the customer that's suffering the problem. And oftentimes the empathy gives you the solution\n",
      "553 - 558  whereas the passion you have for whatever you think the solution is might be 30 degrees off\n",
      "558 - 565  with the solution actually is. And so this development of empathy is a key part of it. And of course,\n",
      "566 - 571  as I think about the discipline of crafting product experiences, to me it's all about psychology.\n",
      "571 - 577  It's about understanding the natural human tendencies that people have in their most primal moments.\n",
      "578 - 583  I talk a lot about the first mile experiences that we have across any product we use, whether\n",
      "583 - 588  we're a consumer or an enterprise user. And the first 30 seconds of using a new product,\n",
      "589 - 594  you are lazy, vain, and selfish. You want to get it done super quickly, you want to look good\n",
      "594 - 599  to your colleagues or to your friends, you want to feel successful very quickly by engaging in this\n",
      "599 - 604  product. You don't want to have to watch a tour read anything, you know, really endure any learning\n",
      "604 - 610  curve whatsoever. Of course, if you can get people through the first 30 seconds, you have so much\n",
      "610 - 614  opportunity to build a more lasting relationship with that customer and have them understand your\n",
      "614 - 619  mission and the full potential of your product. But we need to kind of ground ourselves with the\n",
      "619 - 625  fact that that's really hard to do. It's fascinating to me that most teams spend the final mile\n",
      "625 - 630  of their time building the product, considering the first mile of the customer's experience using\n",
      "630 - 636  the product. If you can just get more customers through that top of funnel, you are a world-class\n",
      "636 - 642  product team, you know, let's anchor ourselves on just doing that and let's use psychology to do so.\n",
      "643 - 647  And just to make sure people understand when you talk about the first mile, essentially that's\n",
      "647 - 652  the onboarding flow may be to the activation moment. I think that's right. It's the onboarding flow.\n",
      "652 - 658  It's the initial experience. It's the defaults that you see. It's the orientation of where you are.\n",
      "659 - 663  So many products. You actually don't exactly know how you got to where you are and how to get home\n",
      "663 - 670  and where to get help. So I would say it's the onboarding. It's the orientation and it's the defaults.\n",
      "670 - 675  You've been a constant and early advocate of investing in that part of the funnel. And it's\n",
      "675 - 680  interesting how often that comes up on this podcast when people think about how do we improve\n",
      "680 - 684  attention, how do we improve growth, often the biggest wins from stories that we get on\n",
      "684 - 690  this podcast are in that part of the flow. And so another data point to spend more time there.\n",
      "691 - 695  And as I wanted to ask you, are you finding even at the stage of like an Adobe, there's still\n",
      "695 - 699  lots of opportunity in the first mile or do you find that it becomes less and less and less\n",
      "699 - 705  and then there's less important. The answer is lots of opportunity. The reason is because the\n",
      "705 - 712  customers change. Every new cohort of new customers is different. The new customers you have in the\n",
      "712 - 716  early stages of your product are typically more willing and forgiving customers. And you might\n",
      "716 - 721  nail the onboarding process for them. And then suddenly realize that wait, it's not being as effective\n",
      "721 - 725  anymore. And the reason is because now you're engaging more of those pragmatist customers. Those\n",
      "725 - 730  later stage customers who are initially more skeptical, less forgiving, less willing to deal with\n",
      "730 - 735  your friction. And so you have to reimagine the onboarding process all over again.\n",
      "735 - 740  I mean, when you look at a product like Photoshop, for example, it used to cost hundreds and\n",
      "740 - 745  hundreds of dollars. Right? Now you can get Photoshop for as little as 10 bucks a month. And so of course\n",
      "745 - 751  the funnels a lot larger, a lot more people come in with creative desires without the skills or the\n",
      "751 - 756  tolerance to develop them. And so that dictates an entire change in the onboarding experience for\n",
      "756 - 762  a product like Photoshop. It makes me think of something Shashir, the Sea of Kota, shared about how\n",
      "762 - 766  he's like, I don't really buy this idea product market fit because you have product market fit with\n",
      "766 - 770  your existing users that love it and know about it. And you always don't have product market fit with\n",
      "770 - 775  the people you want to be used the product. And it's related to what you're talking about. Like the\n",
      "775 - 780  newest people joining up no idea what you're doing. I agree with that. And I actually think that the role\n",
      "780 - 787  of AI going forward will be to have applications increasingly meet us where we are. To this day,\n",
      "787 - 792  we've always had to generalize onboarding experiences for the most part for everyone. And I'm really\n",
      "792 - 796  excited about the day when kind of products meet us where we are, you know, based on what type of\n",
      "796 - 802  user we are. I have a billion AI related questions for you. So I'm going to hold off just a\n",
      "802 - 807  problem. A bit. And I wonder the double click on the empathy piece. So you talk about how to\n",
      "807 - 812  become better at product sense empathy and understanding the user's problems is really important.\n",
      "812 - 816  You have any advice for someone that wants to build that. Like what can I actually do to become\n",
      "816 - 823  more empathetic and build that part of their skill set? Well, the most humbling moments for me as a\n",
      "823 - 828  product leader have always been, shoulder to shoulder to customers, watching them actually go about\n",
      "828 - 833  their day. Not just use my product, but go about their day. Because what you end up getting is context\n",
      "833 - 839  for a lot of data that you're missing. When customers are using your product, they're using it\n",
      "839 - 844  amidst everything else around them. You know, in the enterprise it's all their other, you know,\n",
      "844 - 848  products and things that they're getting throughout the day and as a consumer. You know, it's\n",
      "848 - 853  between dealing with their kids or their loved ones or watching Netflix or whatever the case might be.\n",
      "854 - 857  And in order to really understand where the customers and where their mentality is, you have to\n",
      "857 - 863  understand the context in which they're using your product. So part of developing empathy is being\n",
      "863 - 868  shoulder to shoulder and just encountering that reality, you know, alongside your customer. And that\n",
      "869 - 875  time, it just gives you better intuition. It helps you understand more. And with empathy, we can\n",
      "875 - 879  then better create quote unquote for ourselves, right? Because by developing empathy for others,\n",
      "880 - 884  we're feeling with their feeling. We can then be the customer. And of course, we all know some\n",
      "884 - 888  of the best customers, some of the best products in the world are made when we are, you know,\n",
      "888 - 893  the makers are the customer. It makes me think of Mark and Dreson as this awesome quote that I always\n",
      "893 - 897  come back to that everyone's time has already allocated. They don't have time for your product.\n",
      "898 - 901  They're not right. How do I find a new app to suck up on that? And by the way, as a\n",
      "901 - 906  related note, since I know Lenny, you talk to a lot of gas around and productly growth, you know,\n",
      "907 - 912  and sorry, from skipping around here. But I think this is also relevant because everyone's\n",
      "912 - 918  trying to get their products to grow. And the other thing that propuxes me is that people expect\n",
      "918 - 924  product leaders, expect people to talk about a product being great. And people don't talk about\n",
      "924 - 928  a product doing exactly what they expected it to do. They talk about a product doing what they\n",
      "928 - 934  didn't expect. And you know, you look at a product like Tesla, you know, people are not going and talking\n",
      "934 - 939  about how they had a great drive today. But they're talking about the Easter egg. They discovered\n",
      "939 - 945  on the dashboard or the, you know, cool new feature that, you know, they discovered that is associated\n",
      "945 - 951  with Christmas or whatever. And so it always is interesting to me, like in consumer and even enterprise\n",
      "951 - 958  products, maybe especially so like why aren't we optimizing for those things that people wouldn't\n",
      "958 - 962  expect the product to do as a way to get that surprise and delight to talk about it, to have like\n",
      "962 - 967  it, you know, to develop kind of a relationship with our products. I think that's another piece of the puzzle.\n",
      "968 - 971  That is really interesting and reminds me of something I just talked about with\n",
      "971 - 977  Gustav from Spotify, who's episode Mike coming out before this or after this, about how\n",
      "977 - 981  every great consumer product pulls some kind of magic trick and I feel like magic to you,\n",
      "981 - 986  like Spotify as an example. And I like that, you know, magic, you know, sort of a little mystery,\n",
      "986 - 991  a little intrigue, a little surprise. It's a classic trick that Holly would use this all the time.\n",
      "991 - 996  Why don't we use it in our own products? So let me pull on that thread a little bit about just\n",
      "996 - 1001  consumer products in general. You spend a lot of your career, maybe most of your career in consumer\n",
      "1001 - 1007  or imagine Adobe, there's a lot of B2B elements now as well. And you also angel invest and you help\n",
      "1007 - 1013  a lot of consumer companies and tell me if you agree, but it feels like new consumer products\n",
      "1013 - 1019  basically never work. And if they do work, there's like a period where they work, like B-real is\n",
      "1019 - 1022  kind of going through this now clubhouse, pop or odds you went through this and then they fail,\n",
      "1023 - 1027  or, you know, fade away, maybe they come back and then fade away again. I guess first of all,\n",
      "1027 - 1033  do you generally agree that like consumers just like so rarely successful and you consume products?\n",
      "1034 - 1040  You know, Uber was a consumer product, right? But it built a network effect that was never there before.\n",
      "1040 - 1045  It leveraged excess capacity that was always there but never tapped. It did something\n",
      "1045 - 1050  under the hood, right? That gave it lasting power. You know, I think a Pinterest, you know,\n",
      "1050 - 1057  and I was Ben's first seed angel or, you know, an and product advisor and, you know, with with\n",
      "1057 - 1065  that product, it was, you know, he had this like unique insight into the consumer psychology where\n",
      "1065 - 1073  it was not as much about getting likes and portraying, you know, yourself through pictures of you\n",
      "1073 - 1079  and seeing pictures of friends and all this sort of anxiety that is induced by that. But rather\n",
      "1079 - 1085  helping people collect and, you know, represent themselves with their interests. And so, again,\n",
      "1085 - 1092  that was kind of like a new insight that I also think developed its own network effect that\n",
      "1092 - 1096  enabled it to be lasting. And there was a fascinating business component, which was a drove\n",
      "1096 - 1101  a crap load of traffic to every source of every pin, which then got those sites to then put pin buttons\n",
      "1101 - 1105  themselves because they wanted more traffic. So they were underlying things under the hood again\n",
      "1105 - 1111  that were, you know, it's sort of tilting the market in his favor. I think that a lot of these other\n",
      "1111 - 1120  more recent consumer products are just kind of clever momentary interfaces. And they are an effect\n",
      "1120 - 1126  at the expensive venture capitalist R&D for the platforms that already have the network effects\n",
      "1126 - 1130  and already have the distribution channels and the ad sales and everything else. And so I think that's why\n",

      "1163 - 1168  what else you find is important for a durable new consumer product to work.\n",
      "1170 - 1175  Yeah, and it's interesting because I think my answer 10 years ago, we probably be different\n",
      "1175 - 1183  than my answer today. I think that there is a nimbleness and a, and maybe it started in China with\n",

      "2942 - 2949  object model, what I mean is, is it clear whenever you're seeing the product, like how it works,\n",

      "2958 - 2962  And I feel like every screen, every product experience, you should be able to answer those three\n",
      "2962 - 2967  questions. Sometimes I'll be talking to a team that says they're designed driven, you know, says that they're\n",
      "2967 - 2973  building an incredible product and they'll show me a demo and I'm like, this is all over the place.\n",

      "3098 - 3105  it's if resources are cards resourcefulness is like muscle, it stays with you, it makes you stronger\n",
      "3105 - 3112  and it helps you have a better, better intuition, you know, and better performance over time.\n",
